This is not your usual alarm clock. Sleep Cycle tracks you while you sleep and will wake up you up at the right time, when you're in an almost awake cycle of sleep.

It does so by the vibrations or by the sound of your breathing. 

[Sleep Cycle is available for Android and iOS](https://www.sleepcycle.com/)
